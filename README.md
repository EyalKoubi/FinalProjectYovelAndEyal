Final Project (Software Engeeniring Bs.c. Yovel Cohen and Eyal Koubi)

Our project introduces a system designed for the automatic selection of optimal frames from laryngoscopic videos. This step is critical in addressing the diagnostic challenges associated with Laryngopharyngeal Reflux (LPR) disease, a condition characterized by a wide range of non-specific symptoms that complicate accurate diagnosis. By harnessing various image processing techniques—such as segmentation, clustering, and shape recognition, alongside focus measures—we aim to autonomously identify frames that most effectively reveal the condition of the larynx. This system propose is to enhance the precision and objectivity of LPR diagnosis and also set a foundation for the development of a decision-support tool for medical professionals. Additionally, our project explores the use of advanced autofocus functions to ensure that selected frames meet the standards of clarity and focus, further facilitating the early detection and accurate diagnosis of LPR. Through rigorous experimental research and adaptation of these methodologies to the specific challenges of laryngoscopy video analysis, our project aspires to significantly improve the diagnostic process, offering a pathway towards more reliable and standardized medical assessments.
